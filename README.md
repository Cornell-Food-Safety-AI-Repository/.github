# A platform for hosting food safety datasets to facilitate AI development

This is a collaborative project from Cornell and Verginia Tech with the aim to curate publicly available datasets in the field of food safety. By hosting datasets specific to solving different food safety challenges, we hope to advance the development of AI algorithms specific to food safety datasets and stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations. 

Contact Luke Qian (cq87@cornell.edu) if you have questions using datasets or would like to host your own dataset.
